            <h1>motivation</h1>
            <p>
                In the course of life, I ended up daily driving 400-600mg of caffeine. 
                Recently, I have reduced my daily consumption to something closer to 0-200mg. 
                I've notirced differences in how caffeine affe8cts my body.
            </p>

            <p>
                My restraint around caffeine (at times) has been a lot lower than most of my friends. 
                Over the last few years, when Iâ€™m particularly stressed/demotivated by work, I would regularly daily-drive 400-600mg of caffeine. 
                Broadly, I think this was probably bad for my sleep quality and relationship to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few weeks ago, in the process of cutting back caffeine, I drank a Celsius energy drink (nominally containing 200mg of caffeine) by diluting it with 3 liters of water. 
                This spread out the 200mg over the entire day, and at the end of the day, I felt more wired than I typically do.
            </p>
            <p>
                To build some intuition around why this would happen, I would like to model the flow of caffeine through my body 
                Specifically, I would like to do so using electronic circuit elements, because those are Well Understood, and doing so makes simulation (using LTSpice) quite straightforward.
            </p>

            <h1>modelling assumptions</h1>
            <p>
                The biggest assumption we're making is that the speed of caffeine absorption and metabolism is constant over time.
                Pharmakokinetic research supports this assumption -- the mechanism of caffeine tolerance is in the brain, where the number of adenosine receptors will change.
            </p>

            <h1>how does caffeine flow through the body?</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I consume some liquid that is caffeinated.</li>
                    <li>The liquid collects in my digestive system</li>
                    <li>The caffeine is absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach and small intestine</li>
                    <li>Caffeine in the bloodstream diffuses (bidirectionally!) through the blood-brain barrier</li>
                    <li>Caffeine is filtered through the kidneys</li>
                </ul>
            </p>


            <h3>modelling diffusion</h3>
            <p>
                We can model diffusion using an RC circuit
            </p>
            <h3>modelling collection</h3>
            <p>
                We can model collection of caffeine in a place (e.g stomach) using an integration circuit.
            </p>

            <h1>putting it all together</h1>

            <h1>simulation!</h1>
            <p>
                On my computer, I use LTSpice to simulate circuits. 
                However, my cursory search revealed that there are not any good SPICE libraries for Javascript, so the easiest way to simulate the circuit is by using its transfer function.
