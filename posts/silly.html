    <h1>silly things i did that i think are funny despite requiring low effort on my part</h1>
    this is like my resume but for being silly.<br>
    this list is chronological.
    <ul>
        <li> i developed a preference for eating oreos by rinsing them under a faucet </li>
        <li> i started to use python scripts to automate actions in an online strategy game , but took down their server
            bc each API response was ~5 mb and i was making thousands per minute. </li>
        <li> let a stranger from the internet take me into a cave with their friend </li>
        <li> took the amtrak from los angeles to albuqueruque overnight in a coach seat </li>
        <ul>
            <li>made friends with the person i sat next to/slept next to.
                she was an antivaxxer (so it was a little awkward to maneuver around that topic) but was otherwise a
                well-meaning person.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> ordered a 50lb sack of potatoes to the office on instacart in order to feed them to my coworkers </li>
        <ul>
            <li>i tripped a breaker by using three microwaves on the same circuit to cook potatoes for 12 people.</li>
            <li>potatoes can require up to 15 minutes of continuous microwaving. this usage pattern permanently
                destroyed my coworker's personal microwave
                (which he brought in because i was hogging the microwave by cooking potatoes).</li>
        </ul>
        <li> in a job interview, when my interviewer asked if i had any questions, i asked if he liked rats </li>
        <ul>
            <li>i did not get an offer :(</li>
        </ul>
        <li> ate a microwaved potato during an onsite whiteboarding session </li>
        <li> took two of my friends to look at the dumpster behind an apartment building for 20 minutes. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>i thought there would be rats. i saw rats the last time i looked at the dumpster. but there were no
                rats.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> slept in a dog bed for a week in my friend's closet (the dog bed has only ever been used for humans, to my
            knowledge) </li>
    </ul>
