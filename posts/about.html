            <ul>
                <li>friend from childhood said that i'm a cryptid</li>
                <li>my current manager described me as mystical to someone that is coworking out of our office</li>
                <li>friend in undergrad said that i'm like a lychee - prickly on the outside but subtly sweet on the inside</li>
                <ul><li>hopefully i have become less prickly since undergrad!</li></ul>
                <li>'you are neither feminine nor masculine - you are just Silly'</li>
                <li>manager from a previous job said (using other words) that i am a good shape rotator</li>
                <li>once my dad said that my emotional state is like the S&P 500, in that it it doesn't go down too much (but also doesn't go up too much)</li>
                <ul><li>i don't think this reflects the state of the market nor my internal state, but i aspire to be good at lowpass filtering my thoughts</li></ul>
                <li>old coworker said that i am 'sense-plan-act' kind of guy bc i will regularly take long pauses in conversation to come up with a thing to say</li>
                <li>friend i bumped into in a house i was crashing in said that i speak like an LLM (i.e with high precision)</li>
            </ul>
