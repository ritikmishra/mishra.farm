            <p><em>my brother, hustler that he was, instilled a ‘please try’ mindset into me. but i need myself to
                    augment it with ‘dont give up’.</em></p>
            <br />

            <p><em>i wrote with my friend’s younger brother in mind.
                    he is so energetic and curious. i want him to be strong enough to stay that way even when it
                    hurts.</em></p>

            <h1>please try</h1>
            <p>please for the love of god you have to try. you have
                to. it is your duty as a human to try. i want you to try. you need to try every day. i will be sad if
                you <em>don’t</em> try. its ok if your best isn’t very good but you have to try. you have to. every
                other mammal on earth yearns for food, water, companionship, shelter. but as a human you get to have
                dreams beyond that. to become a really good baker. to make the world’s best sewing machine. to have a
                particular reputation. </p>
            <br />
            <p>its risky to try. if it was easy there would be no
                need to try - you would have already done it. but to not try is to not believe in yourself. and if you
                don’t believe in yourself, who will?</p>


            <h1>please dont limit yourself</h1>
            <p>some my peers have left mn with me. and it has worked
                out well for all of them! they have grown faster than ever before, not only as engineers, but as
                friends, members of the community, partners, and lovers. </p>
            <br />
            <p>some of my peers are truly doing well in their
                postgrad life in mn. someone who used to be a captain on my hs robotics team is now married to his
                partner of 6 years (a very sweet man who is a singer + business owner). he’s doing quite well, and i
                don’t think it makes any sense for him to leave behind what he’s built.</p>
            <br />
            <p>but this leaves behind the people i feel melancholy
                for. some of my peers started undergrad with respectably lofty dreams. to leave minneapolis to go to a
                bigger city. to study marine life abroad. to go and become the world’s best pediatrician. but as the
                years passed, they slowly but steadily found their home and built their lives locally. without a doubt,
                they are happy. but they can’t stomach the risk of leaving now, and it is highly unlikely that they will
                be able to handle the risk later. especially as the risk is unlikely to shrink. as cute boy turns to
                boyfriend to husband to coparent. as 1 year of experience becomes 5 becomes 10, and your tenure makes
                your become more and more cozy with staying there forever</p>
            <br />
            <p>those are not lives i could live. to be so averse to
                risk that i don’t try something when failure is most manageable? </p>


            <h2>i have suffered but it was worth it</h2>
            <p>leaving minnesota was probably the hardest thing i’ve
                ever done. with the exception of one, all of my close friends were in minnesota. of the friends that i
                had in high school, i didn’t maintain friendships with anyone who ended up going to undergrad out of
                state. of the friends that i had in undergrad, i had beat them to departure by a full year. </p>
            <br />
            <p>i did it anyways though. because it is my duty to try.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>it was incredibly lonely to begin with. but over time,
                this went away. i became friends with my coworkers. i competed on the USC ballroom dance team for a
                semester (despite my only affiliation to USC being that i was near the school). i became a somewhat
                regular ?attendee? at the nearest climbing gym.</p>
            <br />
            <p>the pressure has forced me to fix personality flaws
                that beget loneliness. i’m much less socially anxious now than i used to be in 2022. i’m much better at
                talking to strangers and becoming their friend. i’m much more comfortable talking about things that
                aren’t directly related to my professional interests. i learned that it is better to reach out when i’m
                in pain than it is to withdraw into myself and grit my teeth through it. </p>
            <br />
            <h2>its going to be ok , even if your attempt goes poorly</h2>
            <p>i fucking love one piece. a story of a bunch of people
                who leave home to go chase their dreams. its not easy by any means. every arc brings nearly all of the
                crew members to the brink of death. every member of the crew (the captain included) has an arc where
                they crash out over unresolved matters at home. but! its okay. because in the course of their journey,
                they make incredibly strong friends that understand these problems. friends that share a value system.
                friends that share the same trauma and understanding of what its like to leave home to go search for
                something you love. friends who are there to support each other through tough times.</p>
            <br />
            <p>real life is like that too. </p>
            <br />
            <p>after a while, my employer that I moved to LA to work
                for had a huge layoff. (they’ve more or less come back from that, but it was quite harrowing in the
                midst). i was not affected, but i was catastrophically demoralized all the same — i stopped having
                anything to look forward to at work. the corporate financial constraints that led to a bunch of my
                friends being laid off also meant that most of the interesting hardware projects were put on hold
                indefinitely. </p>
            <br />
            <p>but we were okay anyways. ex-coworkers who left before
                the layoff happily and freely referred layoff victims. when i called my friends, they were more than
                willing to pick up the phone and offer me advice* on what to do next</p>
            <br />
            <figure><a href="/images/try/advice.png"><img style="width:709.98046875px"
                        src="/images/try/advice.png" /></a>
            </figure>
            <br />
            <p>*of course, when you seek advice, its important to
                also be thoughtful about where that advice is coming from. but i had faith that all of my friends were
                Also Trying. </p>
            <br />
            <p>i ended up leaving to go to a different startup.
                naturally, as with any attempt at anything, it was not completely smooth sailing either. but, the
                friends i had made in my post-minnesota journey made that transition easier. </p>
            <h1>when you try, it has to be something you want - not
                something other people want</h1>
            <p>it will almost never lead to self-fullfillment to go
                down a path that is prescribed to you by others. how many students actually truly enjoy school? how many
                kids end up studying engineering because their parents made them go into a field they didn’t want to
                pursue?</p>
            <br />
            <p>if you are trying to do something but the something is
                not coming from your heart, it will be that much more difficult to stand strong against struggles. </p>

            <h1>no wallowing allowed</h1>
            <p>one step at a time and you will go far. what is a
                marathon but just hundreds of thousands of steps taken in rapid succession? which is not to say that a
                marathon is easy. even though i run regularly, i don’t have the stamina to compete in a marathon. </p>
            <br />
            <p>but you need to take forward steps. </p>
            <br />
            <p>it took me a long time to get my social anxiety to be
                as low as it is today. but i didn’t stop. every now and then i would work up the courage to talk to a
                coworker i barely knew. a stranger in the climbing gym. a stranger in a bar. a stranger in a coffee
                shop. a stranger in the park. after every interaction, i became a little more confident. even in the
                failures, i learned [oh, it was not useful for me to open that way]. </p>
            <br />
            <p>in a sense, i still have a long ways to go. but we are
                not in stasis. and that’s good.</p>
            <br />
            <h1>hey i think this post is cope actually</h1>
            <p>this post is 100% cope. but the act of creation makes
                me feel better. </p>
            <h1>are you ok?</h1>
            <p>every day is a blessing, a lesson, and an opportunity
                to take another step.</p>
            <p>its not easy by any means but at least i’m not in full
                stasis.</p>
